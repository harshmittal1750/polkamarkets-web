# Parametric

Parametric is an Autonomous Prediction Market Protocol built for multi-chain information exchange and trading, based on Polkadot.

## Overview

Our web interface is built with React.

The backend and Ethereum integrations are being developed through [`polkamarkets-js`](https://github.com/Parametric/polkamarkets-js) package. You can have a look on our smart contract [here](https://github.com/Parametric/polkamarkets-js/blob/main/contracts/PredictionMarket.sol).

We're currently running on [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) and [Moonriver](https://moonbeam.network/networks/moonriver/). You can access it at [https://app.polkamarkets.com](https://app.polkamarkets.com)

```

2. Try again

> Shorthand commands: `yarn cache clean && yarn storybook`

#### Babel loader crashing between React JS Scripts

1. Clean up `node_modules`
